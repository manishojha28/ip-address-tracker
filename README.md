# create-react-app

This project uses the popular create-react-app (CRA) command to setup a modern React application. This way we can focus on the code itself, and not worry about configuring many build tools.

The package.json file provides four scripts:

1. start: Runs the app in the development mode.
2. build: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
3. test: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
4. eject: Remove create-react-app build dependency from your project.
